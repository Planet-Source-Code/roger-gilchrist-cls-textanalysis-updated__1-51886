## cls\_TextAnalysis\(updated\)


</div>

### Description

a class that performs basic text analysis using the Split command. Count characters, words, punctuation and layout characters. Thanks to merlin who found a bug in the basic countChar routine (answered 1 if there was no text in serch string) and 'Word counter *Excellent' who inspired me to attempt it. 

----

Thanks to Min Thant Sin for finding two bugs. Fixed the bug for blank text. Corrected the word count to give correct count. Also extended the class by adding the ability to set acceptable punctuation to allow hyphanated or underscore connected words to be counted as one. Included a bas module that contains the same concepts but designed to be used without the full class being impelmented, just take the bits you want, this bas module uses Paramaters rather than Properties to operate. (NOTE the bas file is not used by the demo).
